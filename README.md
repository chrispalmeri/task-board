# task-board

## Locally

### Setup

  * `git clone git@github.com:chrispalmeri/task-board.git`
  * Create `.env` file with `NOAA_GRID`, `NOAA_STATION`, `NOAA_AGENT`
  * `vagrant up`
  * View it at http://localhost:8080/
  * Visit `/db/install.php` for fresh database, or drop you `database.db` into `www/db/`
  * Make code changes

### Testing

  * You can test the `/api/update`, it should work but will not change web root so you won't see any changes
  * You could `vagrant ssh`, `cd vagrant`, `sudo ./install.sh` to serve that instead of local copy, you would have to `vagrant provision` to revert
  * also to add db to that environment within vagrant `sudo cp /vagrant/www/db/database.db /srv/task-board/www/db/database.db`
